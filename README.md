# Fittr
Fittr is a fitness application that tracks your activity whether it is walking, running or cycling and for every meter you get coins and experience points. The app acts as a B2C in a way that we connect customers to businesses through the vouchers the businesses provides on our app which can be bought by the coins made on the app.
